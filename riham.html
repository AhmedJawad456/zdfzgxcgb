<p><strong>Riham</strong> got a lot of charachteristics that makes her special and unique. One of them is loyalty <br>
Riham is the loyalist friend I've ever had, through our long friendship she endured my annoyng stories and conversaitions but she never left me.
<br>Riham is the friend I needed and never dissapointed me and even after 3 years of friendship she surprises me day after day which makes me feel lucky for having such amazing friend.
<br>Riham is not a person, Riham is the whole world and I wouldn't bother myself to make this website if you are not special to me. <br>
And I know that you are reading my words with a cute smile and speechless face.

    <br>Also I wish that you and I will get to 200k messages this year and more.
    <br> Riham, words can't describe what I wanna say and what you mean to me so I will let this simple website show the gratitude for our friendship.
 <br>I wish you to be healthy and stop eating junk food.
 <br>I won't pray that we stick together this year because we will stick together forever and forever after.
 <br>In the end thanks for this year and every year,thanks for being with me, thanks for being Riham.
    </p>
